\subsection*{Experience}

    \begin{adjustwidth}{10pt}{10pt}

        \notice{Python software engineer at Tochka Bank} / \textit{05.2019 – present}

        \begin{itemize}

        \item Designed, developed and launched a quick payments service from scratch. Quick payments service is financial infrastructure that provides an ability to make payments without cash or plastic cards using a QR-code (merchant side) and a mobile phone app (customer side) in near-real-time.

        \item Fully designed, implemented and configured CI/CD process including unit and integration testing, code analysis, application build and deployment which increased code quality, lowered bugs quantity and reduced feature release delay to several minutes.

        \item Took part in development of financial analysis web tools backend that helped entrepreneurs to possess comprehensive information about theirs financial statistics. The tools provided a lot of visual information like charts and tables based on statistical analysis, classification and clusterization algorithms that helped out customers to reduce their expenses. As a result the service received positive user feedback and most of the customers extended theirs trial subscription.

        \end{itemize}


        \notice{Python Software Engineer at Yandex} / \textit{11.2018 – 05.2019}

        \begin{itemize}

        \item Took part in development of a highly-performant and highly-available task scheduler SAAS that provided optimal company cluster resources utilization which reduced the company expenses. The service was able to store and process several petabytes of user data in multiple data centers.

        \item Took part in development and improvement of service API and SDK providing an ability to describe complex execution pipelines on several thousand of servers in multiple data centers providing high availability 24/7.

        \end{itemize}


        \notice{Python / C++ Software Enginer at USSC Ltd.} / \textit{08.2016 – 11.2018}

        \item Rewritten some security modules from multi-threaded to asynchronous execution model which greatly increased software performance and made it possible to monitor much more production facilities without hardware update.

        \item Developed a module that used SCAP (security content automation protocol) standard to analyze OS integrity and protection using open world-wide vulnerability database which let to detect 0-day vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

        \end{itemize}
